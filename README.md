# CaliforniaGas
Summarizing the cost of gas over the last year within the state of California.

I'm working on this project gradually to get a better understanding of different libraries I can utilize as dependencies to visualize data I've collected from receipts over the past year of buying gas for my sports utility vehicle in San Diego, CA. 

This is a work in progress so please excuse the mess for the time being, thanks for checking it out!
